The *Canvas* used to render Pages on Modern Browsers is totally different than the fixed-position grid layout used by a Page on the IBMi

Not only does the realstate is larger and varying in its dimentions but the color schema is almost incomparable.

Typical color effects in IBMi such as *reverse-video* look **horrendous** on a Modern Browser, in additional, we can identify typical information as obsolete, such as:

* Display Current Date and Time
* Display Username
* Display name of Program associated with Page.

These items of informatin are readily available as part of the *Operating System*. Removing these types of redundant items from Legacy Pages, improves significantly their *Modern* look
