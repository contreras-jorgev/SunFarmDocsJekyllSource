1. This Guide **is not** meant to be a Tutorial.
2. This Guide **is not** an Introduction to *ASNA Monarch Nomad* Migration Technology.
3. Cloning the *Reference GitHub Repository* (see [About](/about/)) **is not** enough to run the SunFarm Application. You will need access to the **ASNA Monarch Nomad&reg; Framework** *NuGet*  dependencies [^1].
