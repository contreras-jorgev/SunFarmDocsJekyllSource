Legacy IBMi Applications were *typically* navigated using keyboard special keys. We are talking about the **F** (or *Function*) keys IBM keyboards have on top of the keyboard. 

Pages are described in *Displayfile*s on the IBMi Platform using a language called DDS.

A *Displayfile* describes one or more *records* (sections of a page), where the developer can inidcate which of the *Function* keys are *Active*, keys that are allowed for the operation and navigation of the page.

It became a common practice to show such *active* keys as constant labels on the Page, where the label would show the number of the *Function* key and a short description of it's related command. Refering back to [Guide Objective](/guide-objective) where we have shown the *Original Page One*, you can see a constant label at the bottom that reads:

~~~   
F3=Exit
~~~   

In addition to *Function* keys, there are other *Aid* keys used for navigation, such as: **Enter**, **PageUp** and **PageDown**. These are typically **not** presented along with the *Function* keys when they are active (*Enter* is reserved to **Submit** the Page for processing)

During Migration *ASNA Monarch Cocoon for Nomad&reg;* will use DDS keywords to extract *Active* aid keys and present them as a Navigation menu (to the left of the Page). Different to typycal IBMi legacy pages, the **Enter**, **PageUp** and **PageDown** navigation buttons will be presented, in case the Device being used, does not have an attached keyboard, such as a *Tablet* or a large *Smart Phone*.

The DDS keywords had limited space to describe the *Active* aid keys, and the Text was optional, in which case the Migration cannot help to improve the label on the Navigation Menu item.

# Enhancing the Navigation Menu

Recall that this Guide covers only two of the Pages used by the *SunFarm* Customer Application.

Both Pages are described in the **CUSTDSPF** Displayfile which became the ASP.NET Web Page *CUSTDSPF.cshtml" file.

ASP.NET Web Pages are described by the *[Razor Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)* syntax, which extends HTML.

ASNA Monarch Nomad&reg; provides *TagHelpers* to repesent DDS equivalent artifacts.

The *TagHelper* that controls the *Active* Functions keys that will be part of the *File* Navigation Menu is:

```html
<DdsFunctionKeys />   
```   

You can find this TagHelper typically at the top of the Page, right under the *DdsFile* TagHelper inside the **HTML* form Tag. 

The following are the first *Markup* lines if the *ASP.NET* Page CUSTDSPF.cshtml:

```html
<form id="MonarchForm" method="post">
    <DdsFile DisplayPageModel="Model">

        <DdsFunctionKeys />

        <main role="main" class="display-element-uninitialized">
           .
           .
           .
```   

*TagHelpers* provide access to class Properties via *attributes* in the markup. Whenever the attribute is nor present, its value takes a *Default*. *DdsFunctionKeys* TagHelper has an attribute called:

~~~
Location
~~~

The default value of *Location* is **VerticalLeft**. Let's change the value such that the *Navigation Menu* is shown at the bottom of the Page[^1].

```html
<DdsFunctionKeys Location="HorizontalBottom" />
```

Build the Application, and run it to see how this small change makes a big difference:

## Improve command names

Each *Active* aid key typically executes a command, with a name that comes from DDS keywords.

As he have mentioned before, Monarch Nomad&reg; Applications may run on *Devices* that do not have keyboard attached. A *command* or *Key* name such as:

~~~
F3
~~~

Means nothing to a *Tablet* user who has never seen an IBMi Application.

Better *key* names than:
1. Enter
2. F3
3. PgUp
4. PgDn

For the menu items for the *DdsFile* in **DSPF** Page, are:

1. Submit
2. Exit
3. ◀ Page
4. Next ▶

All we need to do is change the KeyNames attribute for the **"SFLC"** record, from:

```html
<DdsSubfileControl For="SFLC" KeyNames="ENTER 'Enter'; PageUp; PageDown;" ...
```

to

```html

<DdsSubfileControl For="SFLC" KeyNames="ENTER 'Submit'; F3 'Exit'; PageUp '◀ Page'; PageDown 'Next ▶';"
```

Build the Application and run it. 

Verify the Navigation Menu changes:

<sub>Notice how *hovering* over the menu name shows the *Active* key associated (useful for Users that have keyboards attached to their device)</sub>
